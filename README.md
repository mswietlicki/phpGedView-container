# phpGedView-container

Goal of this repo is containerize PhpGedView.

*[PhpGedView](https://wiki.phpgedview.net/) (PGV) is a revolutionary genealogy program which allows you to view and edit your genealogy using a web interface. As a flexible, collaborative web server program, hosted online, PhpGedView has full editing capabilities, full privacy functions, can import standard GEDCOM text files from most genealogy programs, and it supports multimedia like photos and document images.*

It has a last stable version 4.2.4 (from 2011) build for php 5.3 and MySQL 5.1 and "current" 4.3 version that is more up to date but installed from source code directly. 

I aim to create docker images for PhpGedView v4.3 that would be "up to date", easly run locally or in the cloud.
